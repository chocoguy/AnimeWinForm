# AnimeWinForm

This is a very basic Anime tracking application built in winforms, Built mostly for me.

I decided to use winforms because it was simple enough in the future I might migrate it to a cross platform framework

Application is currently being developed, will work on it when I can. When version 1 is released I will include a full release with an executable and all that.


## Planned Features

- Live database support as opposed to SQLite
- MPV.conf file editor
- Torrenting feature
- Weekly schedule form
- Sleeker UI
