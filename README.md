# AnimeWinForm

This is a very basic Anime tracking application built in winforms, Built mostly for me.

I decided to use winforms because it was simple enough in the future I might migrate it to a cross platform framework

Application is currently being developed, will work on it when I can. When version 1 is released I will include a full release with an executable and all that.


## Update! December 18 - 2022

Have not played around with this in a while, For the next release I plan to add a weekly schedule feature, the
MPV conf toggler and cleaner UI. Will work on it when I can. But I have a good feeling that progress will be steady
from now on
